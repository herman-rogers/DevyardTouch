This repo will be the initial touch movements to be used in our upcoming Monster game -- a game about mystery and detective intrigue. Well, maybe not. But this will contain all the user interaction with the touch screen and the code that powers that. It will be using Unity3D ( 2D ), touchscript ( from the unity store ), and C# for the heavy lifting. All of this is free to use -- and if you want to give credit then make sure to add in the "Devyard" somewhere.
